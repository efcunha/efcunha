## About me... ##

I'm Edson F. Cunha, I used to be an infrastructure specialist, but today I dedicate myself to the area of â€‹â€‹DevOps and FullStack Developer.

I discovered what my profession would be from my first contact, in the programming class of the technical course, in high school.

I have been working in the information technology field for over 20 (Twenty) years.

Professionally, I have worked in companies in the technology area of â€‹â€‹the Armed Forces, Department Stores, Grupo Frigorifico and currently in the Government of the State of Mato Grosso https://www.tce.mt.gov.br/.

Today I am a Junior Developer with less than 1 (One) year of experience in the programming area, but I have focused on studying and learning a range of tools,

For example: JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, React, AngularJS, Express, MongoDB, Restfull APIs, Kubernetes, Docker, Microservices, CI/CD, Git, Jenkins and etc...

Now I participate in some projects with tasks of lesser complexity, without so many demands.

Currently participating in project planning for having a vast experience giving directions, explaining, reviewing some tasks, with this I am able to develop myself better in the development area, and also for studying several platforms and understanding where each one can be used within a cloud or on-premises infrastructure.

I am accomplished and passionate about what I do.

I frequently update myself on new technologies.

I seek to develop myself in agile development teams.

ðŸ‘€ ``` I am improving my knowledge as a Full Stack Developer / DevOps Engineer as much as possible ```
